# Monitoring of COVID-19 for Italy 
The main of the app is to monitor the covid-19 situation at the local level (province) and the country level. 
Moreover, projections based on statistical model are obtained and the weight on the health infrastrucures are evaluated.
The purpose of the app is purely illustrative.

The app is hosted at: [https://luigic.shinyapps.io/covid/](https://luigic.shinyapps.io/covid/)

The panel control reports the detail of the four tabs as reported below:

## <a style="color:dodgerblue">Province tab</a>

Plot 1) Daily increase of positive case. 2) Total number of positive cases.

## <a style="color:dodgerblue">Region tab</a>

Plot 1) Daily increase of: Hospitalized, ICU and deaths by region. Plot 2) Total number of Hospitalized, ICU and deaths by region

## <a style="color:dodgerblue">Nation tab</a>

Plot 1) Cumulative number of infected people and projection up to 15 days for 3 model: Exponential, 2nd degree Polynomial and Logistic. Map 1) Distribution by province of the number of infected

## <a style="color:dodgerblue">Health Infrastructures tab</a>

Map 1) Ratio between the number of people in ICU and the total number of ICU beds at regional scale<sup>*</sup>. 
Map 2) Number of people in deaths for each region.  
 
<sup>*</sup><a style="color:green;">Data on the number of ICU beds is continously increasing, and are recovered from "unofficial" source (i.e. regione.it, newspapers)</a>
